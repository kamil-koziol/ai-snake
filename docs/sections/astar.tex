\section{A*}
\label{sec:astar}

The A* algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, but it introduces a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal. The algorithm maintains an open list of nodes to be explored and a closed list of nodes that have already been visited. It iteratively selects the node with the lowest cost and expands its neighbors, updating their costs and parent pointers if necessary.

\subsection{Integration}

At each frame findPath in A* algorithm is used to find path between snake's head and apple whilst avoiding walls which are represented as snake's tail

\subsection{Results}

By implementing the A* algorithm in a snake game, we can provide an intelligent pathfinding mechanism for the snake to reach its food while avoiding obstacles. It is not a perfect solution but a satisfying one. It's easy to implement and integrate with game.
