\section{Introduction}

This project intends to compare and implement four different AI implementations that can be utilized for creating game-playing bots. The focus will be on comparing the performance and effectiveness of :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Game conditions
    \item A* Algorithm
    \item Genetic Algorithm,
    \item Supervised Classification,
    \item Deep Q-Network (DeepQ),
    \item NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT),
\end{itemize}

\section{Game}

The game in which the algorithms will be tested is an original implementation of the well-known game Snake. This custom Snake game is developed using the Pygame library, which provides a set of tools and functionalities for creating 2D games.
