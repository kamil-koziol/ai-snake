\section{Introduction}
This project intends to compare 4 different AI implementations 
which can be used when making bots that play games

This project intends to compare and implement four different AI implementations that can be utilized for creating game-playing bots. The focus will be on comparing the performance and effectiveness of :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Genetic Algorithm,
    \item upervised Classification,
    \item Deep Q-Network (DeepQ),
    \item NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT),

\section{Game}
The game in which the algorithms will be tested is an original implementation of the well-known game Snake. This custom Snake game is developed using the Pygame library, which provides a set of tools and functionalities for creating 2D games.
