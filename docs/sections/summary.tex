\section{Summary}

Observation algorithms, such as Conditions and A*, can yield highly accurate results but may not necessarily optimize the process. When it comes to the snake game problem, genetic algorithms can achieve impressive performance, although the complexity increases due to factors like luck-based elements such as initial weights, biases, mutations, and crossovers. In the context of Supervised Classification, the main challenge lies in effectively separating valuable data from irrelevant data, often requiring a substantial amount of gameplay data. The integration of multiple playing strategies can introduce inconsistencies in the data, making it difficult to learn from it. Ultimately, genetic algorithms offer interesting new gameplay strategies, while other algorithms provide more explicit strategic approaches.
